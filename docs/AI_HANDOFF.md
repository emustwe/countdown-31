## Stable project state

- Demo tournament: `/events/demo-moomorrow-cup`
- Admin campaign studio: `/admin/tournament/demo-moomorrow-cup/campaign`
- Demo sponsor login: `moomorrow-demo` / `DemoSponsor123!`
- Frontend: Next.js application under `Frontend/`

- Sponsor lifecycle: draft ÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â¢ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚Â ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢ Brand and Safety review ÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â¢ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚Â ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢ approved ÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â¢ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚Â ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢ published
- Public runtime reads only approved, published campaign revisions.

## Preserve these unrelated working-tree paths

These files existed outside the tournament task and must not be staged or removed without an explicit user request:

- `Frontend/next-env.d.ts`
- `Frontend/tsconfig.tsbuildinfo`
- `Frontend/UI assets/0825.mov`
- `Frontend/test-results/`
- `Frontend/Frontend.zip`
- `Frontend/Frontend 8-27-2026.zip`
- `countdown31-tournament-sponsor-platform-plan.pdf`

## Recovery notes

- The dedicated tournament branch was created from commit `9545119` on the earlier `feat/admin-panel-and-game-studio-overhaul` branch.
- The Tailscale Funnel configuration maps the public root to frontend port 3000 and port 8443 to backend port 4000, but local services must be running after a reboot.
- On 2026-08-27, Prisma reported an old failed initial migration although the live schema matched `prisma/schema.prisma` exactly. An empty schema diff was verified, then all existing migrations were recorded as applied; `prisma migrate status` now reports the database up to date.
- Do not restore the removed fake Data URL upload fallback or the removed create-on-read tournament behavior.
